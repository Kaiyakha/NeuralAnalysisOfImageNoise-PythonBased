# NeuralAnalysisOfImageNoise
A neural network to learn to recognize noise strips in satellite images, pure Python.

To make everything work properly:
1) run Crop.py
2) run Noise.py
3) run Train.py (the amount of epochs should be set to at least 1e6)
4) if the resulting accuracy is not satisfactory enough, repeat step 3 again
5) run Test.py or Example.py (optional)

The main script has not been written yet, but I hope I'll get around to it soon
