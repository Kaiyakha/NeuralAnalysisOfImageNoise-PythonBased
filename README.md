# NeuralAnalysisOfImageNoise
A neural network to learn to recognize noise strips in satellite images, pure Python.

To make everything work properly:
1) Run Crop.py
2) Run Noise.py
3) Run Train.py (the amount of epochs should be set to at least 1e6)
4) If the resulting accuracy is not satisfactory enough, repeat step 3 again
5) Run Test.py or Example.py (optional)

The main script has not been written yet, but I hope I'll get around to it soon
